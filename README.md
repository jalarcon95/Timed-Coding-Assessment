# Timed-Coding-Assessment
Multiple-Choice Coding Assessment with timer and high scores data

## Description

In this application, I am building a timed coding quiz from scratch. The coding quiz is a series of multiple choice questions with a timer in the upper-right corner of the page. The user has to answer all of the questions before the time expires. Note, that each incorrect answer will penalize the user by 10 seconds. Once the quiz is over, the user will need to type in their initials to register their score. The user can view previous high scores and choose to clear out the scores.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and my score
